Description: These challenges focus on finding vulnerabilities in binary executables (often compiled C or C++ programs) and exploiting them to gain control over the system.
Common Skills: Buffer overflow, stack smashing, format string vulnerabilities, heap exploitation, and return-oriented programming (ROP).
Example: Exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in a C program to execute arbitrary code and retrieve the flag.
