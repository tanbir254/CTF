Exploring the possible vulnerabilities of a web application is a key part of ethical hacking, penetration testing, and secure software development. For educational purposes, here's a **comprehensive list of vulnerabilities**, categorized by layer or type, based on industry standards like OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project).

---

## üîê **1. Authentication & Authorization Vulnerabilities**

These relate to how users are verified and what they're allowed to do.

* **Broken Authentication** (e.g., session hijacking, credential stuffing)
* **Broken Access Control** (e.g., Insecure Direct Object References - IDOR)
* **Account Enumeration**
* **Privilege Escalation**
* **Password Reset Poisoning**

---

## üìù **2. Input Validation & Injection Attacks**

These arise from improperly handled user inputs.

* **SQL Injection**
* **Command Injection**
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Reflected, Stored, DOM-based
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
* **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection**
* **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**
* **Path Traversal**
* **CRLF Injection (Response Splitting)**
* **LDAP Injection**
* **Host Header Injection**

---

## üß† **3. Logic & Business Logic Vulnerabilities**

Errors in how application logic is implemented.

* **Infinite Money / Points / Credit Loopholes**
* **Coupon Abuse**
* **Bypassing Payment Gateways**
* **Race Conditions**
* **Order Manipulation (e.g., modifying item price in cart)**

---

## üß∞ **4. Misconfiguration Issues**

These occur due to insecure or incorrect system settings.

* **Security Misconfiguration** (e.g., default creds, verbose errors)
* **Exposed Admin Interfaces**
* **Open Ports or Unsecured APIs**
* **Directory Listing Enabled**
* **CORS Misconfiguration**
* **Missing or Misconfigured Security Headers**
* **Debug Mode Enabled in Production**

---

## üóÇÔ∏è **5. Data Exposure & Cryptographic Issues**

Sensitive data can be leaked or poorly protected.

* **Sensitive Data Exposure (PII, Credit Card numbers)**
* **Insecure or No HTTPS**
* **Weak or Improper Encryption**
* **Hardcoded Secrets in Code**
* **JWT Misconfiguration**
* **Cache Poisoning**

---

## üßÆ **6. API-Specific Vulnerabilities**

APIs often expose more than intended.

* **Mass Assignment**
* **Improper Rate Limiting**
* **GraphQL Injections**
* **Lack of Resource & Object Level Authorization**
* **BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization)**

---

## üßæ **7. Client-Side Vulnerabilities**

These happen in the browser, often due to how scripts are handled.

* **DOM-based XSS**
* **Clickjacking**
* **Insecure JavaScript Dependencies**
* **Insecure Local Storage Use**
* **Insecure use of `eval()`**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **8. Server & Infrastructure Vulnerabilities**

The back-end infrastructure can also be attacked.

* **Outdated Software**
* **Known CVEs in Libraries**
* **Unpatched Operating Systems**
* **Weak SSH/FTP Configurations**
* **Improper Container Configurations**

---

## üì¶ **9. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**

Arise from dependencies and third-party code.

* **Malicious NPM/PyPI Packages**
* **Compromised CI/CD Pipelines**
* **Open Source Dependency Vulnerabilities**

---

## üîÑ **10. Miscellaneous / Advanced**

Some additional categories:

* **WebSockets Attacks**
* **Session Fixation**
* **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)**
* **Subdomain Takeover**
* **DNS Rebinding**
* **Clickjacking**
* **Time-based Attacks (e.g., Timing Oracle)**

## üß™ Tools for Testing These Vulnerabilities

| Category             | Tools You Can Use                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| General Scanning     | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Nikto        |
| SQL Injection        | sqlmap                              |
| XSS                  | XSS Hunter, manual testing          |
| Server Security      | Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS               |
| API Testing          | Postman, Insomnia, OWASP API Top 10 |
| Source Code Scanning | SonarQube, Semgrep, Bandit (Python) |
